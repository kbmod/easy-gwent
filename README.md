## The project

Easy Gwent focuses on the card game found inside **The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt**,
not the later standalone GWENT game. The rules engine is kept separate from the
React interface so gameplay remains deterministic, testable, and reusable by
the AI and multiplayer server.

```text
packages/
├── data      Card definitions, shared types, and faction lists
├── engine    Pure rules, scoring, setup, and multiplayer protocol
├── ai        Easy, medium, and hard opponent heuristics
├── client    React and Vite browser interface
└── server    HTTP, WebSocket, authentication, rooms, stats, and SQLite
```

The repository is a strict TypeScript npm workspace. Tests live beside their
packages under `packages/*/test/` and run with Vitest.

---

## Run it locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kbmod/easy-gwent.git
cd easy-gwent
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:8787`. The production-style server hosts the built
client, API, WebSocket endpoint, card assets, and local SQLite database from a
single process.

For live development, use two terminals:

```bash
npm run dev:server   # API and multiplayer server on :8787
npm run dev          # Vite client on :5173
```

Useful checks and asset commands:

```bash
npm test                  # complete Vitest suite
npm run build:code        # build without downloading card images
npm run fetch-assets      # fetch missing card images only
npm run build-card-text   # refresh committed card text
npm run refresh-wiki-cache # refresh gitignored rules references
```

To rebuild a single side after a change, see [build.md](build.md):

```bash
npm run build -w @gwent/server   # server changes; needs a restart
npm run build -w @gwent/client   # client changes; served immediately
```

## Card text and artwork

| Material | In Git? | How it is handled |
|---|---:|---|
| Ability and flavor text | Yes | Stored in `packages/data/src/card-text.json`; missing entries fall back to generated rules text. |
| Card artwork | No | Downloaded at build time from URLs in `scripts/asset-manifest.json` into the gitignored `assets/cards/` directory. |
| Raw wiki reference | No | Cached under the gitignored `.wiki-cache/witcher3-gwent/` directory for mechanics verification. |

If artwork is unavailable, the client uses generated SVG placeholders, so the
game and code-only build remain functional.

## Deploy your own instance

You need Node.js 20 LTS or a newer LTS release, npm, persistent storage for
SQLite, and—if the instance is public—a reverse proxy with HTTPS and WebSocket
support.

### 1. Install, verify, and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kbmod/easy-gwent.git
cd easy-gwent
npm install
npm test
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run build
```

`npm run build` downloads the uncommitted card artwork and creates both the
client and server bundles. Use `npm run build:code` if you intentionally want
placeholders only. `npm start` runs the built server bundle, so a build has to
succeed before the first start.

### 2. Start the application

```bash
HOST=127.0.0.1 PORT=8787 npm start
```

The defaults can be overridden when needed:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Server bind address |
| `PORT` | `8787` | HTTP and WebSocket port |
| `GWENT_DB` | `packages/server/data/gwent.sqlite` | Persistent SQLite database path |
| `STATIC_DIR` | `packages/client/dist` | Built client directory |
| `ASSETS_DIR` | `assets` | Root containing downloaded card art |
| `GWENT_GRACE_MS` | `60000` | Reconnect window before an online forfeit |
| `GWENT_ROOM_WAIT_MS` | `1800000` | Unstarted room lifetime |
| `GWENT_POSTGAME_MS` | `600000` | Completed room/rematch lifetime |

Keep the SQLite database and its `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars on persistent storage.
The included `packages/server/scripts/backup-db.mjs` script creates a safe
SQLite backup.

### 3. Put it behind HTTPS

A minimal Caddy configuration automatically handles TLS and WebSocket upgrades:

```caddyfile
gwent.example.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8787
}
```

Run `npm start` under a process supervisor such as systemd, using an unprivileged
service account and the repository as its working directory. Point the service at
the built bundle (`node packages/server/dist/index.js`) rather than a TypeScript
loader.

Builds are deliberately not wired into startup, so nothing rebuilds on restart.
After pulling updates, rebuild explicitly — see [build.md](build.md). A server
rebuild needs a restart; a client rebuild is served immediately from the new
static bundle.
